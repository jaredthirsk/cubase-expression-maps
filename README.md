Expression Maps for Cubase

These are some Cubase expression maps (articulations) I put together for myself for Vienna Symphonic Library.  

These are time consuming to make so if I can help others avoid having to do this, I am happy to share with no strings attached.  If you're really grateful for this, you can                     [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jaredthirsk).

Mostly for programmers at this point, and it is still partially a manual process and only automates a few things: [cubase-expression-map-editor](https://github.com/jaredthirsk/cubase-expression-map-editor)

## Status

More or less done enough for me: BBO, VI SE.
My next focus: Solo Strings, Strings Pro, Elite Strings, and any BBO I'm missing.

I've done more than this status table indicates, but best to assume the worst.

Heads up: I'm on an old version of Cubase at the moment: 6.0.7.  (I don't know of any changes or compatibility issues with the expression map files.  There's a bug in the expression map editor: if there are a ton of articulations, you cannot drag an articulation below a certain point in the editor.  I'm thinking of upgrading Cubase for the bezier curves in MIDI CC lanes.)

# Setup instructions

## Dimension Strings

 - VelXF: change from CC2 to CC1
 - Legato: change vibrato control from CC1 to C0 (whole notes)

## Abbreviations

 - F - Full (for solo strings, as opposed to basic)
 - SE - Special Edition
 - SY Synchron - recorded for Synchron player
 - SYd Synchronized - recorded for Vienna Instruments and converted for Synchron player
 - SYE - Synchron Elite Strings
 - SYP - Synchron Strings Pro
 - VI - Vienna Instruments

# How to design these❔❔❔

It can be tricky and there are tradeoffs.

I use only use directions, no attributes.

I try to be complete with articulations so that there is a one to one mapping between Cubase articulation and VSL articulation, even though this is a very large number of articulations.  Exception:
 - Dimension strings: player selection

## Guidelines

### Group 1

 - (primary articulation or articulation family)
   - long
   - short

### Group 2

### Group 3

 - attack
 - normal  (TODO: rename all normal2's to normal, since there is never any normal in group 1)

### Group 4

 - release 
 - layers
  - fff
   - without fff
   - soft
