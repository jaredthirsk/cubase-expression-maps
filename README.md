Expression Maps for Cubase

These are some Cubase expression maps (articulations) I put together for myself for Vienna Symphonic Library.  

These are time consuming to make so if I can help others avoid having to do this, I am happy to share with no strings attached.  If you're really grateful for this, you can                     [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jaredthirsk).

Mostly for programmers at this point, and it is still partially a manual process and only automates a few things: [cubase-expression-map-editor](https://github.com/jaredthirsk/cubase-expression-map-editor)

## Status

More or less done enough for me: BBO, VI SE.
My next focus: Solo Strings, Strings Pro, Elite Strings, and any BBO I'm missing.

I've done more than this status table indicates, but best to assume the worst.

# ‡ Notes and Limitations

## Solo Violin

Not supported:
 - Dynamics: articulations for CC3 vibrato switch (not sure how to do these -- I ran out of groups)
 - Scale runs (not worth it?)

# Setup instructions

## Dimension Strings

 - VelXF: change from CC2 to CC1
 - Legato: change vibrato control from CC1 to C0 (whole notes)

## Abbreviations

 - F - Full (for solo strings, as opposed to basic)
 - SE - Special Edition
 - SY Synchron - recorded for Synchron player
 - SYd Synchronized - recorded for Vienna Instruments and converted for Synchron player
 - SYE - Synchron Elite Strings
 - SYP - Synchron Strings Pro
 - VI - Vienna Instruments

# How to design these❔❔❔

It can be tricky and there are tradeoffs.

I use only use directions, no attributes.

I try to be complete with articulations so that there is a one to one mapping between Cubase articulation and VSL articulation, even though this is a very large number of articulations.  Exception:
 - Dimension strings: player selection

## Guidelines

### Group 1

 - (primary articulation or articulation family)
   - long
   - short

### Group 2

### Group 3

 - attack
 - normal  (TODO: rename all normal2's to normal, since there is never any normal in group 1)

### Group 4

 - release 
 - layers
  - fff
   - without fff
   - soft

## Please give feedback
If you want to discuss, contact me via email, create a github issue, or start a thread on [VSL forums](https://www.vsl.co.at/community/forums).

# TODO

 - [ ] My standards shifted a bit while I made these.  So standardize my names for articulation/direction and slot names.  (Look at VSL's names.)

# Misc

 - My Cubase version: 12.0.40
