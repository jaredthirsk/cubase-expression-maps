Expression Maps for Cubase

These are some Cubase expression maps (articulations) I put together for myself for Vienna Symphonic Library.  

These are time consuming to make so if I can help others avoid having to do this, I am happy to share with no strings attached.  If you're really grateful for this, you can                     [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jaredthirsk).

## Status

More or less done enough for me: BBO, VI SE.
My next focus: Solo Strings, Strings Pro, Elite Strings.

I've done more than this status table indicates, but best to assume the worst.

|     | Series | Instrument | Size | Status |
--- | --- | --- |:---:|:--:|
| SYd | Solo Strings | Violin            | 1 | next |
| SYd | Solo Strings | Viola            | 1 | next |
| SYd | Solo Strings | Cello            | 1 | ✅ |
| SYd | Solo Strings | Double Bass  | 1 | ✅ |
| SYd | Special Edition | ... | |
| SY | Elite Strings | ... | |
| SY | BBO | ... | |
| SYd | Dimension Strings | ... | |

Heads up: I'm on an old version of Cubase at the moment: 6.0.7.  (I don't know of any changes or compatibility issues with the expression map files.)

## How to design these?

It can be tricky and there are tradeoffs.
