Expression Maps for Cubase

These are some Cubase expression maps (articulations) I put together for myself for Vienna Symphonic Library.  

These are time consuming to make so if I can help others avoid having to do this, I am happy to share with no strings attached.  If you're really grateful for this, you can                     [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jaredthirsk).

## Status

More or less done enough for me: BBO, VI SE.
My next focus: Solo Strings, Strings Pro, Elite Strings, and any BBO I'm missing.

I've done more than this status table indicates, but best to assume the worst.

Heads up: I'm on an old version of Cubase at the moment: 6.0.7.  (I don't know of any changes or compatibility issues with the expression map files.  There's a bug in the expression map editor: if there are a ton of articulations, you cannot drag an articulation below a certain point in the editor.  I'm thinking of upgrading Cubase for the bezier curves in MIDI CC lanes.)

### Abbreviations

 - F - Full (for solo strings, as opposed to basic)
 - SE - Special Edition
 - SY Synchron - recorded for Synchron player
 - SYd Synchronized - recorded for Vienna Instruments and converted for Synchron player
 - SYE - Synchron Elite Strings
 - SYP - Synchron Strings Pro
 - VI - Vienna Instruments

## How to design these?

It can be tricky and there are tradeoffs.

I try to be complete with articulations so that there is a one to one mapping between Cubase articulation and VSL articulation, even though this is a very large number of articulations.  Exception:
 - Dimension strings: player selection

If you want to discuss, contact me via email, create a github issue, or start a thread on [VSL forums](https://www.vsl.co.at/community/forums).
